# WPA-Text-Editor

## Description

The **WPA-Text-Editor** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that functions as a text editor, allowing users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. This single-page application meets all PWA criteria and includes multiple data persistence techniques to ensure redundancy in case one method is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline, using IndexedDB to save and retrieve data.
